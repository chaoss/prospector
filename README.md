Prospector

Prospector permits automated collection of a wide range of metrics of 
open source projects useful in evaluating the project.

Prospector was initiated by the Red Hat legal department in 2012 with 
the recognition that large portions of the software Industry are 
increasingly being driven by open source innovation. It was designed 
to provide a detailed, objective, and systematic approach to evaluating 
communities. This allows for assessment of the health and trends of 
open source projects.

In 2017 Prospector was licensed under GPL v. 3 and became part of 
the CHAOSS Project.

Initial development of Prospector at Red Hat was led by Harish Pillay
hpillay@redhat.com and with a full time developer, Chow Loong Jin
